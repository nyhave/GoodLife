# GoodLife

This simple React page lets you track weekly goals and actual accomplishments.
It uses CDN versions of React and does not require any build step.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in your browser. You will see a table of example weeks.
You can add your own week goals and what actually happened.
Rows are green when the goal matches the actual value and red when they differ.
