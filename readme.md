# GoodLife

This simple React page lets you track weekly goals and actual accomplishments. It also allows you to record weekly weights and calculates your Body Mass Index (BMI) once you provide your height.
It uses CDN versions of React and does not require any build step.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in your browser. You will see a table of example weeks.
You can add your own week goals and what actually happened. You can also enter your height, add weekly weights and see the computed BMI for each entry.
Rows are green when the goal matches the actual value and red when they differ.
